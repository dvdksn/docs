Administrators can manage companies and organizations using the
[Docker Admin Console](https://app.docker.com/admin). The Admin Console
provides centralized observability, access management, and security controls
across Docker environments.

## Company and organization hierarchy

The [Docker Admin Console](https://app.docker.com/admin) provides administrators with centralized observability, access management, and controls for their company and organizations. To provide these features, Docker uses the following hierarchy and roles.

### Company

A company groups multiple Docker organizations for centralized configuration. Companies have the company owner administrator role available. 

The company owner: 

- Can view and manage all organizations within the company
- Has full access to company-wide settings and inherits the same permissions as organization owners
- Do not occupy a seat

Companies are only available for Docker Business subscribers.

### Organization

Organization owners have the organization owner administrator role available. They can manage organization settings, users, and access controls, but occupy a [seat](/admin/faqs/organization-faqs/#what-is-the-difference-between-user-invitee-seat-and-member). 

- An organization contains teams and repositories. 
- All Docker Team and Business subscribers must have at least one organization.


> [!TIP]
> [Upgrading to a Docker Business plan](https://www.docker.com/pricing?ref=Docs&refAction=DocsAdmin) grants you the company owner role so you can manage multiple organizations.

### Team

Teams are optional and let you group members to assign repository permissions
collectively. Teams simplify permission management across projects
or functions.

### Member

A member is any Docker user added to an organization. Organization and company
owners can assign roles to members to define their level of access.

## Admin Console features

Docker's [Admin Console](https://app.docker.com/admin) allows you to:

- Create and manage companies and organizations
- Assign roles and permissions to members
- Group members into teams to manage access by project or role
- Set company-wide policies, including SCIM provisioning and security
enforcement
